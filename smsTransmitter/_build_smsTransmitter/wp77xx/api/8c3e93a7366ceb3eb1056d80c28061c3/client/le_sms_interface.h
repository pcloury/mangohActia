 *
 * @ref le_sms_interface.h "API Reference"
 *
 * <HR>
 *
 * This file contains data structures and prototypes definitions for high level SMS APIs.
 *
 * SMS is a common way to communicate in the M2M world.
 *
 * It's an easy, fast way to send a small amount of data (e.g., sensor values for gas telemetry).
 * Usually, the radio module requests small power resources to send or receive a message.
 * It's often a good way to wake-up a device that was disconnected from the network or that was
 * operating in low power mode.
 *
 * @section le_sms_binding IPC interfaces binding
 *
 * All the functions of this API are provided by the @b modemService.
 *
 * Here's a code sample binding to modem services:
 * @verbatim
   bindings:
   {
      clientExe.clientComponent.le_sms -> modemService.le_sms
   }
   @endverbatim
 *
 * @section le_sms_ops_creating_msg Creating a Message object
 * There are 3 kinds of supported messages: text messages, binary messages, and PDU messages.
 *
 * You must create a Message object by calling @c le_sms_Create() before using the message
 * APIs. It automatically allocates needed resources for the Message object, which is referenced by
 * @c le_sms_MsgRef_t type.
 *
 * When the Message object is no longer needed, call @c le_sms_Delete() to free all
 *  allocated resources associated with the object.
 *
 * @section le_sms_ops_deleting_msg Deleting a Message object
 * To delete a Message object, call le_sms_Delete(). This frees all the
 * resources allocated for the Message object. If several users own the Message object
 * (e.g., several handler functions registered for SMS message reception), the
 * Message object will be deleted only after the last user deletes the Message object.
 *
 * @section le_sms_ops_sending Sending a message
 * To send a message, create an @c le_sms_MsgRef_t object by calling the
 * @c le_sms_Create() function. Then, set all the needed parameters for the message:
 * - Destination telephone number with le_sms_SetDestination();
 * -  Text content with le_sms_SetText(), the total length are set as well with this API, maximum
 * 160 characters as only the 7-bit alphabet is supported.
 * - Binary content with le_sms_SetBinary(), total length is set with this API, maximum 140 bytes.
 * - PDU content with le_sms_SetPDU(), total length is set with this API, max 36 (header) + 140
 *  (payload) bytes long.
 * - UCS2 content (16-bit format) with le_sms_SetUCS2(), total length is set with this API, maximum
 *  70 characters (140 bytes).
 *
 * When the Msg object is ready, call @c le_sms_Send() to transmit it.
 *
 * @c le_sms_Send() is a blocking function with a maximum timeout set to 240 seconds, it will return
 *   once the Modem has given back a positive or negative answer to the sending operation.
 *   The return of @c le_sms_Send() API provides definitive status of the sending operation.
 * TP-Validity-Period(TP-VP) parameter value indicates the time period for which the short message
 * is valid, i.e. for how long the Service Center (SC) shall guarantee its existence in the SC
 * memory before delivery to the recipient has been carried out. The default validity period(TP-VP)
 * is set to 7 days for MO SMS.
 *
 * When a message sending has failed and returned LE_FAULT, call le_sms_GetErrorCode() to retrieve
 * the 3GPP message error code or le_sms_Get3GPP2ErrorCode() to retrieve the 3GPP2 message error
 * code. If LE_SMS_ERROR_3GPP_PLATFORM_SPECIFIC or LE_SMS_ERROR_3GPP2_PLATFORM_SPECIFIC values is
 * returned, call le_sms_GetPlatformSpecificErrorCode() to retrieve the platform specific error
 * code.
 *
 * Please refer to @ref platformConstraintsSpecificErrorCodes for platform
 * specific error code description.
 *
 * Please refer to @ref c_smsSampleMO page to get an example of SMS message sending.
 *
 * @section le_sms_ops_async_sending Sending asynchronously a message
 *
 * To send an asynchronous message, le_sms_SendAsync() API can be called instead of le_sms_Send().
 * le_sms_SendAsync() is a non-blocking function, it queues the message to the SMS pool and returns
 * immediatly. Then, Legato will internally attempt to send the SMS with a maximum timeout set
 * to 240 seconds for each SMS in the pool.
 * This function is usefull to stack a set of messages without blocking the user application.
 * Moreover, a handler can be specified to le_sms_SendAsync() API in order to keep track of the
 * transmission status.
 *
 * The default validity period(TP-VP) is set to 7 days for MO SMS.
 *
 * A text message can be sent with one simple function: le_sms_SendText(). You only have to pass
 *  the three following parameters:
 * - the destination telephone number.
 * - the text message, the total length are set as well with this function, maximum 160
 * characters as only the 7-bit alphabet is supported.
 * - the callback function to get a notification indicating the sending result: LE_SMS_SENT,
 *  LE_SMS_SENDING_FAILED or LE_SMS_SENDING_TIMEOUT.
 * The default validity period(TP-VP) is set to 7 days for MO SMS.
 *
 * A PDU message can be sent using the le_sms_SendPdu() functions. The parameters to give are:
 * - the PDU content, total length is set with this API, maximum 176 bytes long = 36 (header) +
 *  140 (payload).
 * - the callback function to get a notification indicating the sending result: LE_SMS_SENT,
 *  LE_SMS_SENDING_FAILED or LE_SMS_SENDING_TIMEOUT.
 * The default validity period(TP-VP) is set to 7 days for MO SMS.
 *
 * When a message sending has failed, call le_sms_GetErrorCode() to retrieve the 3GPP message error
 * code or le_sms_Get3GPP2ErrorCode() to retrieve the 3GPP2 message error code.
 * If LE_SMS_ERROR_3GPP_PLATFORM_SPECIFIC or LE_SMS_ERROR_3GPP2_PLATFORM_SPECIFIC values is
 * returned, call le_sms_GetPlatformSpecificErrorCode() to retrieve the platform specific error
 * code.
 *
 * Message object is never deleted regardless of the sending result. Caller has to
 * delete it. Message object once used for sending the message can not be reused to
 * send another message regardless of success or failure. New object has to be created
 * for new message.
 *
 * @section le_sms_ops_receiving Receiving a message
 * To receive SMS messages, register a handler function to obtain incoming
 * messages. Use @c le_sms_AddRxMessageHandler() to register that handler.
 *
 * The handler must satisfy the following prototype:
 * @c typedef void (*le_sms_RxMessageHandlerFunc_t)(le_sms_MsgRef_t msg).
 *
 * When a new incoming message is received, a Message object is automatically created and the
 * handler is called. This Message object is Read-Only, any calls of a le_sms_SetXXX API will
 * return a LE_NOT_PERMITTED error.
 *
 * Use the following APIs to retrieve message information and data from the Message
 * object:
 * - le_sms_GetFormat() - determine if it is a binary or a text message.
 * - le_sms_GetSenderTel() - get the sender's Telephone number.
 * - le_sms_GetTimeStamp() - get the timestamp sets by the Service Center.
 * - le_sms_GetUserdataLen() - get the message content (text, binary or UCS2) length.
 * - le_sms_GetPDULen() - get the PDU message length.
 * - le_sms_GetText() - get the message text.
 * - le_sms_GetUCS2() - get the UCS2 message content (16-bit format).
 * - le_sms_GetBinary() - get the message binary content.
 * - le_sms_GetPDU() - get the message PDU data.
 * - le_sms_GetType() - get the message type.
 *
 * @note  - If two (or more) registered handler functions exist, they are
 * all called and get a different message object reference.
 *
 * @note - For incoming SMS, if the returned format is LE_SMS_FORMAT_PDU, the PDU length can be
 * retrieved by calling le_sms_GetPDULen() and the content can be read by le_sms_GetPDU().
 *
 * If a succession of messages is received, a new Message object is created for each, and
 * the handler is called for each new message.
 *
 * Uninstall the handler function by calling @c le_sms_RemoveRxMessageHandler().
 * @note @c le_sms_RemoveRxMessageHandler() API does not delete the Message Object.
 *  The caller has to delete it.
 *
 * Please refer to @ref c_smsSampleMT page to get an example of SMS message reception handling.
 *
 * @section le_sms_ops_sms_storage Receiving a full SMS storage indication
 * To receive a SMS full storage status, the application has to register a handler function.
 * Use @c le_sms_AddFullStorageEventHandler() to register that handler.
 *
 * The handler must satisfy the following prototype:
 * @c typedef void (*le_sms_FullStorageEventFunc_t)(le_sms_Storage_t storage).
 *
 * Uninstall the handler function by calling @c le_sms_RemoveFullStorageEventHandler().
 *
 * Please refer to @ref c_smsSampleMT page to get an example of SMS storage indication
 * handling.
 *
 * @section le_sms_ops_listing Listing  messages recorded in storage area
 *
 * Call @c le_sms_CreateRxMsgList() to create a List object that lists the received
 * messages present in the storage area, which is referenced by @c le_sms_MsgListRef_t
 * type.
 *
 * If messages are not present, the le_sms_CreateRxMsgList() returns NULL.
 *
 * Once the list is available, call @c le_sms_GetFirst() to get the first
 * message from the list, and then call @c le_sms_GetNext() API to get the next message.
 *
 * Call @c le_sms_DeleteList() to free all allocated
 *  resources associated with the List object.
 *
 * Call @c le_sms_GetStatus() to read the status of a message (Received
 * Read, Received Unread).
 *
 * To finish, you can also modify the received status of a message with
 * @c le_sms_MarkRead() and @c le_sms_MarkUnread().
 *
 * @section le_sms_ops_deleting Deleting a message from the storage area
 *
 * @c le_sms_DeleteFromStorage() deletes the message from the storage area. Message is
 * identified with @c le_sms_MsgRef_t object. The API returns an error if the deletion cannot be
 * performed or if it is a broadcast or a non stored message.
 *
 * @note If several users own the Message object on new reception
 * (e.g., several handler functions registered for SMS message reception), the
 * Message will be deleted from the storage area only after the last user deletes
 * the Message object reference (not necessary from storage). API returns always LE_OK in this case.
 *
 * @note If one client creates a list and deletes all sms from storage, other clients won’t see sms
 *  stored If they have not created a sms list too. Sms List creation locks and
 *   delays sms deletion from storage until all references have been deleted.
 *
 * @section le_sms_ops_broadcast SMS Cell Broadcast
 *
 * The Cell Broadcast service permits a number of unacknowledged general messages to be broadcast
 * to all receivers within a particular region. Cell Broadcast messages are broadcast to defined
 * geographical areas known as cell broadcast areas. These areas may comprise of one or more cells,
 * or may comprise the entire PLMN.
 *
 * GSM or UMTS SMS cell broadcast service can be activated or deactivated with
 * le_sms_ActivateCellBroadcast() and le_sms_DeactivateCellBroadcast() APIs.
 *
 * CDMA cell broadcast service can be activated or deactivated with
 * le_sms_ActivateCdmaCellBroadcast() and le_sms_DeactivateCdmaCellBroadcast() APIs.
 *
 * Cell broadcast message receptions are notify by the SMS handler like a SMS message reception,
 * but there are neither stored in SIM nor in the modem. So le_sms_DeleteFromStorage()
 * can't be used but the message reference shall be delete with le_sms_Delete().
 *
 * - le_sms_GetFormat() - determine if it is a binary or a text message.
 * - le_sms_GetUserdataLen() - get the message content (text, binary or UCS2) length.
 * - le_sms_GetPDULen() - get the PDU message received length.
 * - le_sms_GetText() - get the message text.
 * - le_sms_GetBinary() - get the message binary content.
 * - le_sms_GetUCS2() - get the UCS2 message content (16-bit format).
 * - le_sms_GetPDU() - get the message PDU data received length.
 * - le_sms_GetCellBroadcastId() - get the message identifier received (3GPP 23.41).
 * - le_sms_GetCellBroadcastSerialNumber() get the message Serial Number received (3GPP 23.41).
 *
 * A sample code that implements a function for SMS Cell Broadcast reception can be found in
 * \b smsCBTest.c file (please refer to @ref c_smsCbSample page).
 *
 * @b Serial @b Number
 *
 * Cell Broadcast Serial Number parameter is a 16-bit integer which identifies a particular
 * CBS message from the source and type indicated by the Message Identifier and is altered every
 * time the CBS message with a given Message Identifier is changed.
 *
 * The two bytes of the Serial Number field are divided into a 2-bit Geographical Scope (GS)
 * indicator, a 10-bit Message Code and a 4-bit Update Number as shown below:
 *
 * - GS code (bit 14 and 15): The Geographical Scope (GS) indicates the geographical area over
 * which the Message Code is unique, and the display mode.
 *
 * - Message Code (bit 4 to 13) : The Message Code differentiates between CBS messages from
 * the same source and type (i.e. with the same Message Identifier). Message Codes are for
 * allocation by PLMN operators. The Message Code identifies different message themes.
 * For example, let the value for the Message Identifier be "Automotive Association" (= source),
 * "Traffic Reports" (= type). Then "Crash on A1 J5" could be one value for the message code,
 * "Cow on A32 J4" could be another, and "Slow vehicle on M3 J3" yet another.
 *
 * - Update Number (bit 0 to 3) : The Update Number indicates a change of the message content of
 * the same CBS message, i.e. the CBS message with the same Message Identifier, Geographical
 * Scope, and Message Code.
 *
 * Serial Number fields meaning are defined in the 3GPP 23.041 (9.4.1.2.1 Serial Number).
 *
 * @b Message @b Identifier
 *
 * Message Identifier parameter identifies the source and type of the CBS message. For example,
 * "Automotive Association" (= source), "Traffic Reports" (= type) could correspond to one value.
 * A number of CBS messages may originate from the same source and/or be of the same type.
 * These will be distinguished by the Serial Number.
 *
 * Message identifier meaning ranges are defined in the 3GPP 23.041 (9.4.1.2.2 Message Identifier).
 *
 * @section le_sms_ops_broadcast_configuration SMS Cell Broadcast configuration
 *
 * GSM or UMTS Cell broadcast Message identifiers range can be added or removed with
 *  le_sms_AddCellBroadcastIds() and le_sms_RemoveCellBroadcastIds() APIs. All Message identifiers
 *  can be removed with le_sms_ClearCellBroadcastIds() API.
 *
 * CDMA Cell broadcast Service categories can be added or removed with
 *  le_sms_AddCdmaCellBroadcastServices() and le_sms_RemoveCdmaCellBroadcastServices() APIs. All
 * Service categories can be removed with le_sms_ClearCdmaCellBroadcastServices() API.
 *
 * @section le_sms_ops_statusReport SMS Status Report
 *
 * SMS Status Report may be sent by the SMS Center (SMSC) to inform the originating device about the
 * final outcome of the message delivery.
 *
 * SMS Status Report can be activated or deactivated for outgoing messages with
 * le_sms_EnableStatusReport() and le_sms_DisableStatusReport(). The current activation state can
 * be retrieved with le_sms_IsStatusReportEnabled().
 *
 * The reception of a SMS Status Report is notified by the SMS handler like a SMS message reception,
 * but the message is neither stored in SIM nor in the modem. So le_sms_DeleteFromStorage()
 * can't be used, but the message reference shall be delete with le_sms_Delete(). Received SMS
 * Status Reports are identified by a specific type: @ref LE_SMS_TYPE_STATUS_REPORT.
 *
 * The different elements of the SMS Status Report can be retrieved with the following APIs:
 * - le_sms_GetTpMr() gives the Message Reference, defined in 3GPP TS 23.040 section 9.2.3.6.
 * - le_sms_GetTpRa() gives the Recipient Address, defined in 3GPP TS 23.040 section 9.2.3.14, and
 * the Recipient Address Type of Address, defined in 3GPP TS 24.011 section 8.2.5.2.
 * - le_sms_GetTpScTs() gives the Service Centre Time Stamp, defined in 3GPP TS 23.040
 * section 9.2.3.11.
 * - le_sms_GetTpDt() gives the Discharge Time, defined in 3GPP TS 23.040 section 9.2.3.13.
 * - le_sms_GetTpSt() gives the Status, defined in 3GPP TS 23.040 section 9.2.3.15.
 *
 * @section le_sms_ops_configuration SMS configuration
 *
 *  Modem SMS Center Address can be set or get with le_sms_SetSmsCenterAddress() and
 *   le_sms_GetSmsCenterAddress() functions
 *
 * @section le_sms_ops_storage_configuration Preferred SMS storage configuration
 *
 *  Preferred SMS storage for incoming messages can be set or get with le_sms_SetPreferredStorage()
 *  and le_sms_GetPreferredStorage() functions.
 *
 * @section le_sms_ops_statistics SMS statistics
 *
 * The number of SMS successfully sent or received through the Legato API can be counted.
 * This feature is activated by default. le_sms_GetCount() allows retrieving the message count
 * for each SMS type (cf. @ref le_sms_Type_t).
 *
 * le_sms_StopCount() stops the message counting and le_sms_StartCount() restarts it.
 * le_sms_ResetCount() can be used to reset the message counters.
 *
 * @note The activation state of this feature is persistent even after a reboot of the platform.
 *
 * @section le_sms_ops_samples Sample codes
 * A sample code that implements a function for Mobile Originated SMS message can be found in
 * \b smsMO.c file (please refer to @ref c_smsSampleMO page).
 *
 * A sample code that implements a function for Mobile Terminated SMS message can be found in
 * \b smsMT.c file (please refer to @ref c_smsSampleMT page).
 *
 * These two samples can be easily compiled and run into the \b sms app, to install and use
 * this app:
 *
 *   @verbatim
   $ make ar7
   $ bin/instapp  build/ar7/bin/samples/sms.ar7 <ipaddress>
   @endverbatim
 * where ipaddress is the address of your target device.
 *
 * Then on your target, just run:
 *   @verbatim
   $ app start sms
   @endverbatim
 *
 * The sample replies to the sender by the message "Message from <phone number> received". Where
 * "phone number" is the sender's phone number.
 *
 * Sample code for that application can be seen in the following pages:
